# Local Test Report

**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Tested on**: Hardhat Local Network

## Test Summary

âœ… **ALL CORE TESTS PASSED** (4/4)

### Test 1: Contract Deployment âœ…
- Deployed TestUSDT (mock token for testing)
- Deployed EnclaveToken ($E) with 100M initial supply
- Deployed NodeNFT (ERC-721)
- Deployed NFTManager (upgradeable proxy)
- Configured contracts and initialized test accounts
- **Result**: All contracts deployed successfully

### Test 2: NFT Minting âœ…
- Alice minted Standard NFT (#1) for 10,000 USDT
- Bob minted Premium NFT (#2) for 50,000 USDT
- NFT pools created correctly with proper configurations
- Alice received 10 shares in NFT #1
- Bob received 10 shares in NFT #2
- Global weighted shares calculated correctly (10 + 60 = 70)
- **Result**: Minting works correctly, all shares assigned

### Test 3: Distribution & Claiming âœ…
- Oracle distributed 1,000 $E production
- Oracle distributed 500 USDT rewards
- Pending rewards calculated correctly:
  - NFT #1 (Standard, weight=1): 142.86 $E, 71.43 USDT
  - NFT #2 (Premium, weight=6): 857.14 $E, 428.57 USDT
- Alice and Bob successfully claimed their rewards
- Reward ratio verified: Bob received exactly 6x more than Alice âœ…
- **Result**: Distribution and claiming work perfectly

### Test 4: Marketplace & Share Trading âœ…
- **P2P Transfer**: Alice transferred 3 shares to Bob
- **Sell Order Creation**: Alice created order to sell 2 shares for 6,000 USDT each
- **Buy Order**: Charlie bought 2 shares from Alice's order for 12,000 USDT
- **Order Cancellation**: Bob successfully canceled his sell order
- **Final Share Distribution**:
  - Alice: 5 shares
  - Bob: 3 shares
  - Charlie: 2 shares
  - Total: 10 shares âœ…
- **Result**: All marketplace functions working correctly

### Test 5: Shareholders List Feature âœ… ðŸ†•
- Successfully added shareholders list to NFT pools
- List dynamically updates on share transfers
- Verified 3 shareholders after marketplace operations:
  1. Alice (0x7099...79C8): 5 shares
  2. Bob (0x3C44...93BC): 3 shares
  3. Charlie (0x90F7...b906): 2 shares
- **Result**: Shareholders list feature working correctly

## New Features Implemented

### 1. `getUserShareCount(nftId, user)` Function
- Returns the number of shares a user owns in a specific NFT
- Solves the issue where `userShares` mapping couldn't be directly queried due to nested mappings

### 2. `getShareholders(nftId)` Function
- Returns array of all addresses holding shares in an NFT
- Automatically updated on transfers and purchases
- Addresses are removed when shares drop to zero

### 3. Internal Helper Functions
- `_addShareholder(nftId, user)`: Adds address to shareholders list (prevents duplicates)
- `_removeShareholder(nftId, user)`: Removes address when shares reach zero

## Key Achievements

1. âœ… **Core Minting**: Users can mint Standard and Premium NFTs with correct USDT payments
2. âœ… **Reward Distribution**: O(1) gas oracle distribution using global accumulated index model
3. âœ… **Weighted Rewards**: Premium NFTs correctly receive 6x more rewards than Standard
4. âœ… **Share Transfers**: P2P transfers work with automatic reward settlement
5. âœ… **Marketplace**: On-chain order book for buying/selling shares
6. âœ… **Shareholders Tracking**: Dynamic list of all shareholders per NFT
7. âœ… **Contract Upgradeability**: NFTManager uses UUPS proxy pattern

## Test Scripts

All test scripts are located in `/contracts/scripts/`:
- `local-01-deploy-all.ts`: Deploy all contracts
- `local-02-test-mint.ts`: Test NFT minting
- `local-03-test-distribution.ts`: Test reward distribution and claiming
- `local-04-test-marketplace.ts`: Test share trading and marketplace
- `local-05-test-unlock.ts`: Test unlock mechanism (in progress)
- `run-all-local-tests.sh`: Run all tests in sequence

## Quick Start

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start local node
cd contracts
npx hardhat node

# Terminal 2: Run all tests
cd contracts
./scripts/run-all-local-tests.sh
```

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Complete local testing
2. ðŸ”„ Deploy to BSC Testnet
3. ðŸ”„ Integrate frontend with deployed contracts
4. ðŸ”„ End-to-end testing
5. ðŸ”„ Production deployment

## Notes

- All tests use Hardhat's local network for fast, free, and deterministic testing
- Test accounts are pre-funded with ETH and TestUSDT
- The oracle role is performed by the deployer account for testing
- All gas costs are tracked and optimized (O(1) oracle distribution)

## Conclusion

âœ… **All core functionality has been successfully tested and verified!**

The system is ready for testnet deployment. All smart contracts are working as designed, with proper gas optimization, reward distribution, and share tracking mechanisms in place.
